# IS Charms Contributing Guide

*This contributing guide is under development.*

This project outlines expectations the IS Charms
team has of each other when contributing code to any of the repositories owned
by the team. Changes can be proposed by anyone through pull requests (including
to anything in this file).

Categories:

* [Contributions](CONTRIBUTIONS.md): How to contribute to Juju charms,
how to set repository, how to review a PR etc.
* [Definitions](DEFINITIONS.md): Descriptions of some terms in this guide.
* [Juju Charms](JUJUCHARMS.md): Juju Charms version control, configuration,
libraries etc.
* [Python](PYTHON.md): Python code standars and best practices.
* [Tests](TESTS.md): What to test in a Juju charm.

The structure of the contribution guide is:

* Each line is limited to 80 characters for readability
* The content index is sorted alphabetically to facilitate quickly looking up a
  standard
* Optionally, headings can be used to aggregate similar standards
* Standards should be grouped together for readability when similar, which means
  in the body, they do not have to be sorted alphabetically
* Each standard has the structure:
  * a heading with a name of the standard,
  * a description of the problem it intends to address,
  * the standard and
  * an explanation of how the standard addresses the problem.
